# ConwaysGameOFLife
code that emulates Conway's game of life. built in C and Python

the program uses the ncurses/curses.h header file in order to work
you have to enter a seed as well as a desired mode
or random mode the cell placemenet is dependent of the seen
on load mode the seed does nothing (it comes with 2 loaded programs xGliderGun.gol and yGliderGun.gol both are Gopher's gliders on different axes)
when loading a program do NOT add the .gol extension

to run the programm simply run the run.bat program

to design your own layout use the Grid-Graphic-Maker.pyw and start designing by clicking on the desired cells and saving with a fitting name
